# User Testing Process (for outside testers)

## Beginning Testing (Sprint 2-3)

### ---Undirected Testing: Highly recommended for first playthrough--
Play the game how you would intuitively, without looking up controls. Try to remember anything that didn’t feel right, or anything that you thought should work but didn’t.

### --Directed testing--

Please record any issues you experience while testing

1. When the game is booted you will be on the main screen with buttons for the following: New Game, Options, and Exit Game. Select Options

2. When in options, change the brightness to verify the setting is working.

3. Press the back button to return to the main screen

4. From the main screen, select New Game

5. Progress through the game by fighting the enemies and making it to the end of the level (the exit door)

6. If the enemy kills you, verify the Game Over scene plays
- if this occurs, from the game over screen, select "Restart" to continue playing or "Quit" to end the game.

7. Attempt to break the game - this includes things such as moving out of the map, glitching into terrain, or anything else you would consider not intended to be able to be done. If successful, note the method used to do this. 

8. Finally, at the end of your test, select "Quit" from the pause menu to verify the function is working

9. After finishing the test please return the answers to the following questions



###Follow up questions

1. Did you understand the goal of the game (was it intuitive)?
2. Did you enjoy the game, why or why not?
3. Is there anything related to the gameplay you didn't enjoy?
4. Is there anything not related to the gameplay you didn't enjoy?
5. If applicable, what would you change about the game?
6. Please report any issues, crashes, or anything unexpected that you experienced.
